# Analysing Residuals to Build Better Models

Residuals are used universally for regression problems. They are used to both evaluate how well the model is performing and also look at ways to make it better. In this example, we will be building models to predict used car price and then look at the residuals to see how we can make our models better.

### Getting Started
The jupyter notebook contains all of the code needed to execute this example.

### Problem Type
