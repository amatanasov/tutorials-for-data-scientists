Dataset
We're going to use cleaned 100,000 UK Used Car Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes).

It contains information of price, transmission, mileage, year, manufacturer, model, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size.

The 500 rows holdout sample was created to compute predictions and residuals.
