# Unsupervised Learning

DataRobot excels in finding patterns in cases where a target feature is not available. In Machine Learning, we call this unsupervised modeling and within DataRobot, there are two modes for it:

- Outlier Detection
- Time Series Anomaly Detection

Depending on the use case, you may opt to choose one or the other.
